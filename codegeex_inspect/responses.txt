It looks like the repository has a lot of different directories and files. We should start by looking at the `README.md` file to understand the overall structure and purpose of the repository.

The README.md file provides a brief overview of the repository. It mentions that the repository contains a web application that allows users to type like their favorite authors. This suggests that the repository is related to natural language processing or machine learning, specifically in the context of text generation or style transfer. Let's look at the `server.py` file to see how the web application is structured.
```
open server.py

The `server.py` file is the main entry point for the web application. It uses the Flask framework to create a web server. The file defines several endpoints, including `/upload`, `/chat`, `/history`, and `/delete`. These endpoints handle different aspects of the application, such as uploading chat history, chatting with the LLM, retrieving session history, and deleting user history. The `upload` endpoint is particularly interesting because it takes in chat history from WhatsApp and saves it to the database. This suggests that the repository may be used to analyze WhatsApp conversations. Let's look at the `upload` endpoint to see how it works.
